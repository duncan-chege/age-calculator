# Age calculator app

Calculate your age with this app


## A user should:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
    - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
    - The day number is not between 1-31
    - The month number is not between 1-12
    - The date is in the future
    - The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
